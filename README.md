# Turing-Machine-Simulator
This is a very naive program to simulate Turing Machine with C++

This naive Turing Machine can only recognize character strings made up of 0's and 1's.
It first reads a sequence of 0-1 characters as its machine code, then analyses the meaning of the code and builds a transition table.
Then it uses the transition table to process the input and finally either accepts or rejects the input.
Exception handling adopts a simplified method of exit(-1).

If you are interested, welcome to modify it to be a more powerful one!
