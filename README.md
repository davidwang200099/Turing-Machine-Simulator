# Turing-Machine-Simulator
This is a very naive program to simulate Turing Machine with C++

This naive Turing Machine can only recognize character strings made up of 0's and 1's.
It first read a sequence of 0-1 characters as its machine code, then analyse the meaning of the code and build a transition table.
Then it use the transition table to process the input and either accept or reject the input.
Exception handling adopts a simplified method of exit(-1).

If you are interested in simulating a Turing Machine, welcome to improve it!
